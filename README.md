## Description

Dungeon Mate was created to help assist players and dungeon masters of all kinds with their Dungeons & Dragons needs. You can create character sheets, save, update and delete them.

You can create encounters, quests, dungeons and a full campaign. Each one is able to be saved, updated and deleted.

Update being particularly important as Dungeon masters typically change their campaign on the go as roleplay develops.

This companion type app is designed to be customizable so that the user can choose what to input and where, allowing them full control over their D&D experience with some guidance along the way.


## Usage

log in or sign up with an email/password to get started, use the navlinks at the top to navigate to different pages including bestiary, quests, encounters, dungeons, campaigns and characters.

Character creation requires you to input information into a form, once completed you can save your character and it will appear below where it will have edit and delete buttons.

Campaign creation requires you to input fields for your campaign such as a title, description, if there are NPCs in your campaign, extra notes AND you can drag encounters, quests and dungeons that you've created from the sidebar into your campaign. You can also add creatures by search in the sidebar and save the campaign. Multiple campaigns can be created, edited, deleted.

Dungeon creation requires you to input fields for your dungeon such as title, description and you can drag existing encounters and quests that you have created into your dungeon and save. Multiple dungeons can be created, edited and deleted.

Encounter creation requires a title and description of your encounter. Multiple encounters can be created, saved, edited and deleted.

Quest creation requires a title, description and rewards for quest completion. Multiple quests can be created, saved, edited and deleted.

To use the bestiary you can simply search creatures by name, by challenge rating (based on the team's character levels in your campaign) or even size! You can also just scroll through the entire D&D creature database if you choose, you can click on any creature to view specific details about that creature to see if it will fit in your campaign.

## Full Presentation 



## Future Development

In the future we would like to implement an AI tool that across the entire application can help generate content for your specific needs including but not limited to map generation, base campaign generation, encounter, quest and dungeon generation, full character sheet and background info generation and so much more!

We would also like to add a Sounds page where you can go to find songs, audio files or youtube clips of different background noise for increased immersion in your D&D experience.

A specific NPCs page similar to the bestiary where you can search for existing D&D NPCs within the lore to easily add them to your campaign.
